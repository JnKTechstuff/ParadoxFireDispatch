# Paradox Fire Dispatch - The premiere fire system
This is an original fire script developed by JnKTechstuff(Jake K #2217) with some code from Albo1125's previous fire script. The code has been commented and credited and prior permission granted from Albo1125.


## Primary goals for this project
- Bring fire to every server and allow pull requests to improve it

## Paradox Gaming
This script was developed for Paradox Gaming. A public RP community co-founded by myself and E1Gamer.

If you are looking for a server give ours a try:

[Paradox Gaming Website](https://www.paradoxgaming.co/)

[Paradox Gaming Discord](https://discord.gg/9eBtqEm)

## Using

Be warned that ParadoxFireDispatch is in BETA stages and may **not** be 100% stable.

If you want to use job limits and other things you **must** either adapt the script for ESX or use [ExM](https://github.com/extendedmode/extendedmode)

If you are **not** using any of the job stuff or a different framework **remove** this line in **fxmanifest.lua**:

```lua
shared_script '@extendedmode/imports.lua'
```
